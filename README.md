# Play Jacynth Online: The Multiplayer Decktet Card Strategy Board Game 
The game is played on a 6x6 grid. 
On each turn, a player places a tile to the grid. 
After doing this they may optionally place an influence token onto a tile on the board.
Placing a token on a tile creates a district which consists of all connected tiles that share the same suit as the card the token was placed on. 
Itâ€™s possible for a conflict of control to arise between two players tokens in which 1 player will lose control of their territory, making careful play important. 
At the end of the game the winner is the player in control of the most territory.

This is an implementation of the card game [Jacynth](http://wiki.decktet.com/game:jacynth) from the [Decktet](https://www.decktet.com/). 

You can play the game [here](https://jacynth.herokuapp.com/)!

You can read about the creation of the app [here](https://dylan-cairns.github.io/Jacynth/).

How to update or run (and grok) this code on your computer:
0: clone or fork the repo
1: look at the files for ~15 minutes

  - the files are in /dist/public/assets
  - gigantic styles.css in "/pubic/css
  - notice the difference between public/javascript/controller.js and controller.ts
  - realize this is a perfect case study to understand MVC based design
  - what are the benefits of this wacky structure?
  - did you need to write all that stuff, or was the whole public/javascripts generated from the typescripts?
  - in the controller ts, we are importing from the '../model/decktet.js'; '../model/player.js';
  - and { MultiPlayerView, SinglePlayerView, View } from '../view/view.js';
  - so looks like just a massive blunk of dunks.  gonna take whole pomodoros, might want to watch an explainer video about MVC first
  - and maybe something about typescript?
  - but first, continue spending time on these files

2: zoom in on decktet.js + decktet.ts

  - this is the code that is responsible for the model of the decktet and all its functions
  - left a bunch of comments in there
  - a huge object (hand-coded?) "cards", some functions to assemble a deck and "shuffle" them
  - 
3: read about the creation of the app for 5 minutes?

  - great description of what is the game [here](https://dylan-cairns.github.io/Jacynth/).
  - Coding the logic : The game board : "Initially I started with a 2d array. But I realized that I can get the benefits of a 2d array by using xy coordinates as the ID in a JavaScript Map() , but that it would be much simpler to iterate over." 
    - what?
    - 
4: next step, zoom in on "gameboard.js"

5: A district is any contiguous collection of cards which share the same suit. Recursion was an obvious choice for this problem. 
  - why?


nested iterations losing context? refactor to an arrow function!

6: key Concepts

  - decktet + card
  - gameboard (x y array somehow? checking for available spaces, results, space, resolve influence, district )
  - player
  - model
  - view


7: added socket.on('messageReceived') into player.ts on line 173

8: Views: (home.pug update titles)

9: running this code on local computer

  - npm install
  - npm run start
  - notice the socket.io console.log (a user connected, join room-0)
  - 
10: search all files for "join room" find it in server.js/.ts

11: new key concept: SERVER

  - server deals cards to players, server transpits a card ID, the client use to find the card from its own local copy.
